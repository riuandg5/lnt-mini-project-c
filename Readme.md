# Sudoku Game

<!-- badges -->

<!-- project details -->
This project is part of LnT STEPin SDLC Activity Based Learning. The objective is to apply SDLC, use multi-file programming, do unit testing, use Git and other task automation tools.

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle initially provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

This project written in the C programming language provides an interface for playing the Sudoku game. For more details on the project read the [requirements](1_Requirements/Readme.md) and [design](2_Design/Readme.md) docs. For building the project refer to the [implementation](3_Implementation/Readme.md) doc.
